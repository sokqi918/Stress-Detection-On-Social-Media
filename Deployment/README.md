In this deployment part, I have employed Streamlit to create a simple website, called "Stress-Self Guide Web" for those people who are facing stress or depression.

Sometimes, they just need a pair of ear to listen their story. This website is interaction for users to share their storyand giving some guideline how to handle stress.

In order to deploy Streamlit, we run Streamlit in Anaconda Terminal.

**Open Terminal**
